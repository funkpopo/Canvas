# Design System Decisions

- **Component Library**: Radix UI Primitives for accessible base components.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling and design token management.
- **Icons**: Heroicons outline and solid sets for dashboard visuals, supplemented by Radix UI icons when needed.
- **Charts**: `@visx/xychart` for composable data visualizations.
- **Theme**: Light/dark mode support via CSS variables with future integration to system preferences.

These selections emphasise accessibility, fast iteration, and composability.
